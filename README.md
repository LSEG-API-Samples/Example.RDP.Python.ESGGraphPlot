# Example.EDP.Python.ESGGraphPlot
This example will demonstrate how we can retrieve ESG data from Elektron Data Platform (EDP). We will be using Python with EDP API to request ESG data on the Jupyter Notebook. The notebook allows the user to create and share documents that contain live code, narrative text, visualizations and we can also plot the graph on the notebook.
